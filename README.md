# Roadmap Challenges

Coding challenge to build projects in Golang to meet the requirements mentioned in [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

## Added challenge
- Dumb editor ONLY, i.e. no LSP/Auto-completes/AI etc.
- Use `go doc` for most of the documentation lookup
- Turn off internet while developing. If you got something to look up, then write it down and look it up later.
